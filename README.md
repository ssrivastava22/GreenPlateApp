# GreenPlate

GreenPlate is a food management app built around one core mission: making everyday eating more sustainable. Instead of letting groceries go to waste or struggling to keep track of what’s in the pantry, GreenPlate gives users the tools to plan meals intelligently, shop efficiently, and reduce their overall footprint.
At its core, the app combines calorie and nutrition tracking with recipe management and ingredient monitoring. Users can see what they already have on hand, build meals around available ingredients, and automatically generate shopping lists for anything they’re missing. GreenPlate not only simplifies cooking and shopping but also helps people stick to diet goals and make mindful choices in the kitchen.
